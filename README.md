# Argo Bot

Still a WIP.


## Workflow
Currently can be executed by commenting `argo diff` on an open PR.


## Starting Server
`npm install && npm start`


## Minimal TODO
- Argo-Bot should clone current state of PR, before running argocd diff --local
- Config parameters
- Proper global lock, so one command is executed at a time
